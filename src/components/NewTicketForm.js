/*First, we will create a method called onNewTicketCreation in the parent TicketControl component.
Next, we'll pass the onNewTicketCreation function to its child NewTicketForm component as a prop.
Our child NewTicketForm component has a function called handleNewTicketFormSubmission which correctly gathers user inputs from a form. We will add onNewTicketCreation to the handleNewTicketFormSubmission as a callback.
Form data will be passed into the onNewTicketCreation callback via its parameters.
The parent TicketControl component will have access to that data, which it can then use to add a new ticket to our mainTicketList.*/
